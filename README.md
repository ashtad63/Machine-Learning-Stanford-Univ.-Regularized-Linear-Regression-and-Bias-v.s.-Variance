# Machine Learning Coursera: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance

In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with 
different bias-variance properties.

1. In the first half of the exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression to predict 
the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.
2. In the next half, you will go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine 
the effects of bias v.s. variance tradeoff.
